# Pool Environment
How to load into Gazebo Editor:
   * Use Gazebo Fortress, aka Ignition (due to its compatibility with ROS2 Humble)
   * LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 ign gazebo pool.sdf

# TODO:
   * ROS2 Bridge
   * Hydro
   * Either:
       * figure out how to bind models together (to reduce clutter) or
       * create a Python editor for easier editing
